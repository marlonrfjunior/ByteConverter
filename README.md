# Byte Converter
iOS app built by following the tutorial IOS Swift - the complete iOS-13 App development bootcamp on Udemy. IIn this module, I was challenged to create an application that would show the bytecoin quote according to the country's currency value using API from coinapi.io.

I could learn:

- Learn to use the pickerView.
- Learn about the delegate pattern.
- Swift protocols and extensions.
- Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
- Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
- Learn to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
